# N3MUS Tournament API Documentation for Studios

The N3MUS Studio API allows game studios to fetch tournament data and determine if a player is registered in an ongoing tournament leaderboard. It also enables studios to show past and upcoming tournaments in-game for user engagement.

## How to Check if a Player Is Registered in an Ongoing Tournament

You can determine if a player is participating in the current tournament with the following steps:

### Step-by-Step:
1. **Fetch all tournaments:**
```http
GET https://dev-backend.n3mus.com/studio-api/tournaments/
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer n3m_sk_<your_key>
```

2. **Filter by `status == "ONGOING"`** from the response.

3. **Loop through the `participants[]` array** of the ongoing tournament(s).

4. **Match the `wallet_address`** against the current player's wallet (case-insensitive match).

### Sample Code (Pseudocode)
```csharp
var ongoing = tournaments.Find(t => t.status == "ONGOING");
if (ongoing != null) {
    var player = ongoing.participants.Find(p => 
        p.wallet_address.ToLower() == currentWallet.ToLower());
    if (player != null) {
        Debug.Log("User is registered: " + player.handle);
    } else {
        Debug.Log("User is NOT registered.");
    }
}
```

---

## Displaying Completed & Upcoming Tournaments

The API response includes all tournaments with one of the following statuses:
- `ONGOING`: Active tournaments that users can participate in
- `UPCOMING`: Future tournaments (not yet started)
- `COMPLETED`: Finished tournaments with final leaderboards

### Carousel Integration
Studios are encouraged to create an **in-game carousel UI** that:
- Displays the current tournament
- Allows users to swipe left to view past (COMPLETED) tournaments
- Allows users to swipe right to preview upcoming (UPCOMING) tournaments

Each tournament object includes metadata such as:
- `start_date`, `end_date`
- `banner` URL for visuals
- `slug` for direct registration or leaderboard links (e.g. `https://hub.n3mus.com/tournaments/{slug}`)
- `prize_pool` for the Prizepool size
- `max_winners` for the number of winners
- `tournament_type` Can be SUM_SCORE for 'accumulated points' or HIGH_SCORE for HIGH Score Only

This improves user engagement by showcasing tournament history and teasing upcoming competitions.

---
To determine a player's **total score** and their **ranking** in the leaderboard:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The API does not return `total_score` directly ‚Äî studios must calculate this on the client side.

### Formula
```
Total Score = score + bonus_score
```

The `participants` array is not sorted but we includue the rank ‚Äî you need to include and calculate `total_score` in descending order.

### Example
```csharp
public class Participant {
    public string handle;
    public int score;
    public int bonus_score;
    public int TotalScore => score + bonus_score;
}

List<Participant> sorted = participants.OrderByDescending(p => p.TotalScore).ToList();

// Example display
foreach (var p in sorted) {
    Debug.Log($"{p.handle} - Total Score: {p.TotalScore}");
}
Total Score = score + bonus_score
```

Ensure you reflect this logic in your UI if you're rendering or re-sorting leaderboard data on your end.

---

## Notes
- If `participants` is empty, no players are registered yet.
- Use the `slug` field to build URLs like `https://hub.n3mus.com/tournaments/{slug}`
- Prizes, banners, and types (`SUM_SCORE` or `HIGH_SCORE`) are included per tournament for customization.

---

Studios integrating N3MUS tournaments can enhance UX by allowing players to register for tournaments directly from the game client if they are not already registered.

This guide explains how to create a **JOIN TOURNAMENT** button in both **Unity** and **Unreal Engine** using the tournament `slug` field.

---

## üß† Concept

If a user is **not found** in the participant list of an ongoing tournament, display a `JOIN TOURNAMENT` button that links to:
```
https://hub.n3mus.com/tournaments/{slug}
```
This page allows players to complete their tournament registration via wallet.

---

## üéÆ Unity Integration

### Example Code
```csharp
public void ShowJoinTournamentButton(string tournamentSlug) {
    string joinUrl = $"https://hub.n3mus.com/tournaments/{tournamentSlug}";

    Button joinButton = Instantiate(joinButtonPrefab, parentTransform);
    Text btnText = joinButton.GetComponentInChildren<Text>();
    if (btnText != null) btnText.text = "JOIN TOURNAMENT";

    joinButton.onClick.AddListener(() => {
#if UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS
        Application.OpenURL(joinUrl); // or use UniWebView if embedded
#else
        Application.OpenURL(joinUrl);
#endif
    });
}
```

### When to Show It
```csharp
if (userNotFoundInParticipants) {
    ShowJoinTournamentButton(tournament.slug);
}
```

---

## üïπÔ∏è Unreal Engine Integration

### Blueprint
1. Create a `UMG Button Widget`
2. Set text to `JOIN TOURNAMENT`
3. On `OnClicked` event:
   - Use `Open URL` node with input: 
     ```
     https://hub.n3mus.com/tournaments/{slug}
     ```

### C++ Example
```cpp
FString TournamentSlug = "kugle-test-ongoing";
FString JoinURL = FString::Printf(TEXT("https://hub.n3mus.com/tournaments/%s"), *TournamentSlug);

FPlatformProcess::LaunchURL(*JoinURL, nullptr, nullptr);
```

Call this when the user is not in the leaderboard:
```cpp
if (!bUserInLeaderboard) {
    // Show JOIN TOURNAMENT button
}
```

---

## üí° Summary
- Always use the `slug` field to build the join URL
- Render this button **only** when user is not in `participants[]`
- This link works across desktop and mobile
